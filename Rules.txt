The goal of the game is to fill the board up as much as possible with your color.
Blue starts and green follows
The only rule for laying down pieces is that each piece that is placed on the board must 
touch the corner of another piece on the board of the same color. Pieces cannot touch along the sides

You can cycle through shapes by scrolling the mouse wheel on the shape when it is your turn
You can rotate a shape by right clicking on it

Have fun!
